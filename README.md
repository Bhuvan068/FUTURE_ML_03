💬 AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot

Internship Task – Machine Learning
Organization: Future Interns
Task Number: 03

📌 Project Overview

Customer support chatbots are widely used by companies like Amazon, Flipkart, and Zomato to provide instant 24/7 assistance.
This project implements an AI-powered Customer Support Chatbot capable of answering user queries through text or voice.

Unlike rule-based chatbots, this system uses a generative AI model (Gemini API) to provide intelligent and flexible responses, simulating real-world customer support interactions.

🧠 Key Features

Greeting and conversational customer support flow

AI-generated responses using Gemini API

Smart fallback handling for unclear queries

Speech-to-Text (voice input) support

Persistent chat history using IndexedDB

Clean and responsive UI with real-time typing indicators

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript

Gemini 2.5 Flash API

IndexedDB for client-side data persistence

Web Speech API (Speech-to-Text)

Font Awesome for UI icons

⚙️ How the Chatbot Works

User enters a message (text or voice)

Input is sent to the Gemini API

AI generates a contextual response

Response is displayed in the chat UI

Conversation history is stored locally using IndexedDB
    
Fallback message is shown if the AI cannot respond         
🎯 Learning Outcomes
